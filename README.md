# SolarZip
SolarZipï¼šAn efficient and adaptive compression framework for Sloar EUV data

The code associated with our paper is currently being organized and will be released shortly. In the meantime, we have made the test data publicly available. If you're interested, you can access it here: https://github.com/CapitalLiu/SolarZip-TestData

## Compression performance

SolarZip demonstrated the overall best performance on the rate-distortion curve.
